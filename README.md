## Overview of the Analysis

  1.  Explain how a machine learning algorithm is used in data analytics.
  2.  Create training and test groups from a given data set.
  3.  Implement the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
  4.  Interpret the results of the logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms.
  5.  Compare the advantages and disadvantages of each supervised learning algorithm.
  6.  Determine which supervised learning algorithm is best used for a given data set or scenario.
  7.  Use ensemble and resampling techniques to improve model performance.
